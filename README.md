# Accordion Component v2 | React + TS + Tailwind

This is a simple study project.
* Live-project: (Click-here)[https://accordion-v2.vercel.app/]
* Live v1 project: (Click-here)[https://accordion-pi-mocha.vercel.app/]

* Difference between v1 and v2:
In v1 you could open all accordions at the same time, in v2 you can only open one at a time. So for example, you open the first accordion item, if you click to open the second, the first will close.

### What I've did:
* Father and Child component relation
* Modifying individual Accordion item through click and updating the state afterwards
